#     # MODULE:FUNCTION message description
#     !MSGNUM
#     XXXX MSG
#
#  XXXX is a vector that indicates which help levels get this command.
#  This allows a statement to be display for only a single level or
#  multiple levels.
#     0001 - Help level 0 (BBS)
#     0010 - Help level 1 (EXPERT)

#
#  Macro expansion is used to insert numbers and text into the static
#  lines. These are indicated by a single '%'. The string "%%" prints
#  a real '%' in the text. Current macros are:
#     M - current_message_number
#     B - bbs_callsign
#     C - CurrentUser.call
#     H - CurrentUser.home
#     U - CurrentUser.number
#     S - supplied string
#     N - supplied number (decimal)
#     L - CurrentUser.lname
#     F - CurrentUser.fname
#
#  This file is passed thru a filter program that creates a compressed
#  message file as well as an index file for quicker access of strings.
#
#  Ending a string in ">:?" will cause the message displayer to not append
#  a [CR] to the string. This is used for prompting.

1110 HOW TO USE THIS BBS ======================================================
1110 This bbs was written to provide the most flexibility to the new user
1110 unfamiliar with bbs operation. In the first version of the code all 
1110 user keystrokes were logged. These logs were reviewed to see what 
1110 mistakes were common. It was easy to see how people got discouraged by
1110 repeated failed attempts at simple commands. Thus this bbs was born.
1110
1110 This bbs is compatible to older bbs's in the message commands. You may
1110 still use the "LB" command to list bulletins but you may also issue any
1110 number of variations that will result in the same objective: 
1110    LIST BULLETINS
1110    LIST BULL
1110    LI BU
1110    L B
1110 
1110 And in addition to the more flexible syntax you may also supply multiple
1110 options that modify the result. Such as: 
1110    LIST KILLED PERSONAL         LIST READ BULLETINS
1110    LIST PERS KILL               LB READ
1110    LP K                         LR B
1110    L K P                        L B R
1110
1110 As you can see, the odds of happening across what you want are fairly good.
1110 Or at least your odds are better. In the event that you do type a command
1110 wrong, the system will show you the error in your ways as shown: 
1110
1110    KM 1254
1110       ^--- Syntax Error
1110       KILL MINE doesn't expect addional parameters
1110
1110    LB < %B KILLED "SALE"
1110       ^--------------^--- Syntax Error
1110       Two pattern matches not allowed.
1110
1110 Now you get the idea. This system has 4 levels of help. In the most
1110 novice setting, 3, you will actually be led through improperly entered
1110 commands and the error messages will be verbose.
1110
1110 At help level 2 you will no longer be prompted for the right answer but
1110 you will still get the verbose error reports.
1110
1110 The expert user will end up in level 1. This gives very brief error
1110 messages and assumes that the user knows the command but just made a typo.
1110 It is not very user friendly at this level.
1110
1110 Level 0 is meant to be used only by incoming bbs's. There is no error
1110 messages. You often will not be able to tell if a command you typed has
1110 worked or not. I wouldn't advise using this level.
1110
1110 Throughout the bbs help screens and menus commands and instructions will
1110 be shown as a mixture of upper and lower case letters. The upper case
1110 portion is the required part to satisfy the parser. The lower case
1110 portion can be stopped at any point. It is important that if you
1110 supply more than the minimum number of characters that you continue to
1110 spell the command properly. The parser will compare to the whole word
1110 you supply.  The mixture of upper and lower case letters is for the
1110 help screens,  when typing a command either upper or lower case is
1110 allowed.
1110
1110 Commands and Keywords will always start with a upper case letter. Any
1110 words that begin in lower case are variables that you supply. Words
1110 enclosed in square braces [ ] are optional and need not be supplied.
1110 When words are separated by a '|' you must choose only one of the list,
1110 if they are separated by commas or spaces you can include as many as
1110 you like. Here is an example of the definition of the READ command: 
1110
1110    Read [Mine | msg_num_list] [Header]
1110    Read [File] file_name_list
1110
1110 The READ command is used to read files from the hard disk as well as
1110 messages. The 'R' is all that is required of the READ to be understood.
1110 Same goes for the optional operands MINE, HEADER and FILE. Let's look
1110 closer at the first command.  You have three options when reading 
1110 messages,
1110 
1110    Read Mine              read mail addressed to you
1110    Read 5467 5500 5421    read message numbers
1110    Read                   read the last message you accessed
1110
1110 The Mine and msg_num_list are optional but if you have one you are not
1110 allowed to have the other. The HEADER operand can be added to any of
1110 the forms shown.
1110
1110 This bbs can tell what you want to read, file or message, by the
1110 supplied operands. Messages are numbers and files are words which can
1110 contain numbers but must have at least one character or punctuation.
1110 Therefore the FILE operand is optional. If it is supplied along with
1110 a message number an error will result. It is allowed just to be more
1110 flexible for the user.
1110
1110 With each one of the command definitions there are a few examples
1110 supplied. These examples show a verbose form on the left and to the
1110 right in the [] will show you an optional abbreviated form.
1110
1110    READ HEADER 5678            [RH 5678]
1110    LIST MINE KILLED READ       [LM K R]
1110
1110 These short forms are by no means the only way to represent the command.
1110 They are not necessarily even the optimum way. Just an example.
1110
1110 Now you are about ready to jump in. Whenever you have a question about a
1110 command or a keyword you simply type HELP and the command name or
1110 keyword. The HELP mechanism also supports requests for information other
1110 than commands and keywords. Such as HELP FILESYS will describe the
1110 file upload and download capability along with a menu of the file
1110 system commands. Your help level will determine how much you are told
1110 about a command.
1110
1110 There is a manual available for operating this bbs. It can be found
1110 on the Internet at:
1110
1110   http://www.ke6jjj.net/bbs/docs/N0ARY_BBS_UsersManual.pdf
1110 
1110 Now get started and give it a try. If you have problems send me a 
1110 message by typing: 
1110
1110    SEND SYSOP
1110 
1110 You will be prompted for everything else. By the way, BYE will log you
1110 off, thanks for stopping in!

!937
1110 HISTORY command =========================================================
1110 The HISTORY command can be used to replay commands you have already
1110 executed. Actually the command itself is used to display your command
1110 history stack.
1110
1110    HISTORY [cmd_cnt]
1110
1110 To replay a command off your history stack you need only type "!" and
1110 the command number. To replay the last command executed you can use the
1110 short cut of type "!!".
1110
1110    !12           execute command #12
1110    !!            execute the last bbs command again
1110
1110 Type INFO SHELL for other features of the BBS shell.

!938
1110 LOAD command ============================================================
1110 The LOAD command is used to give a use an idea of the best time to connect
1110 to the bbs. By default it shows you the hourly load on the 2 meter RF port.
1110 The user can optionally choose to see the load on any of the 6 bbs ports.
1110 Some of these are not available to the average user.
1110  
1110    LOAD              show user load by hour
1110    LOAD TNC144       same as above
1110    LOAD TNC220
1110    LOAD TNC440
1110    LOAD PHONE
1110    LOAD CONSOLE
1110 
1110 Type INFO LOAD for a detailed description.

!939
1110 DISTRIBUTION command =====================================================
1110    DIST [List]       show possible distribution lists
1110    DIST Write list   create a distribution list
1110    DIST Kill list    delete a distribution list
1110    DIST Read list    display the contents of a list
1110
1110 Distribution lists can be created to enable users to send a message
1110 to multiple receipents that have something in common while only entering
1110 the message once.
1110
1110 This is aimed primarily at clubs or groups. For instance when a user
1110 issues a command SEND DIST LERA the bbs will open the distribution list
1110 named LERA and send the message to everyone in the list automatically.
1110 Type INFO DISTRIB for more information and examples.
1110

!940
1110 @, ADDRESS, LOCALE tokens ================================================
1110 When sending a message to another user not on the local bbs you will
1110 need to specify an address for the user. The local WP database may
1110 know the address already in which case you need not enter it. An
1110 address consists of a homebbs and additional information necessary to
1110 route a message to the homebbs.
1110
1110      @ %B.#NOCAL.CA.USA.NA
1110
1110 Addresses are started with an '@' and the homebbs call. The different
1110 portions of the hierarchical address are separated by periods. As you
1110 move from left to right you get broader in scope. The LOCALE parameter
1110 is not used in all areas and begins with a '#'. It is also possible for 
1110 2 LOCALE parameters to be present.
1110
1110 This bbs will attempt to fill in the remainder of an address if you
1110 supply only a portions, for instance the .USA.NA will be appended
1110 automatically upon parsing the CA.

!941 ADD and DELete keywords ==================================================
1110 These keywords are used in the EVENT, CLUBS, EQUIP and SKIP commands. They
1110 are equivalent to using '+' and '-'. In the EVENT command there use
1110 is very predictable, only a single ADD or DELETE may appear in the
1110 command. In the CLUBS and SKIP command you may have multiple occurances: 
1110
1110     CLUBS ADD sale lera lprc DEL want + specs
1110
1110 This command would ADD sale, lera, lprc and specs to the list and
1110 DELETE the category want. The operatino to be performed to each
1110 club will be the last operation seen.

!942
1110 LIST command =============================================================
1110    LIST [type] [options] [range] [pattern]
1110    LIST ASCENDing|DESCENDing
1110
1110 The list command will display a list of messages that is a subset
1110 of the total list messages that you are allowed to see and read.
1110 Everyone can see BULLETINS, NTS and mail addressed to or sent by
1110 you. Mail addressed to others is invisible.
1110 
1110 types -
1110    Message types can be Personal, Bulletin or NTs. You should only use
1110    one of these in any request. A message cannot match any two types.
1110
1110 options -
1110    ALL, LAST, NEW, READ, PENDING, OLD, KILLED, HELD, MINE, CLUBS, LOCAL
1110    At any time there are around 2000 messages on the system. You use
1110    these options to scale down the request.
1110       All     - ignore the SKIP list
1110       Last x  - last messages to arrive, defaults to 10.
1110       First x - oldest messages on the system, defaults to 10.
1110       New     - new since previous LIST NEW on early login
1110       Read    - messages that have been read by addressee
1110       PENDing - those awaiting forwarding
1110       Old     - messages about to be deleted by aging
1110       Killed  - messages that have been killed, will remain 3 days
1110       Held    - messages awaiting sysop action
1110       Mine    - messages addressed to you
1110       Clubs   - where your CLUBS list matches the To,From or @ field
1110       LOCal   - messages left on this bbs for it's users
1110
1110    You may specify as many options as you like. The intersection of the 
1110    request is displayed. For instance, LIST PER CLUBS READ KILLED,
1110    will list any PERSONAL message that are in your CLUBS list, that you
1110    have already READ and have been KILLED. It must satisfy all three
1110    conditions, CLUBS, READ and KILLED.
1110
1110 range -
1110    To further narrow the list you may specify message number ranges.
1110    This is done in any of the following forms: 
1110       1000-2000   between 1000 and 2000, '-' is optional could be space.
1110       2000-       from 2000 to last message, '-' is optional
1110       -1000       messages lower than 1000, '-' is required
1110
1110 pattern -
1110    There are 4 different pattern matching commands. The first 3 are the
1110    same as those used to match your CLUBS variable.
1110       < XXXX      match pattern in FROM field
1110       > XXXX      match pattern in TO field
1110       @ XXXX      match pattern in @ field of FROM
1110       XXXX        match pattern in any field, TO, FROM, @ and SUBJECT
1110
1110    The last version is the most powerful, it will check against all of
1110    the three previous fields as well as search thru the SUBJECT field 
1110    for the pattern. The pattern can appear anywhere in the field. If
1110    the pattern you are searching for is a list keyword you will have 
1110    to enclose it in " " so it isn't mistaken for the keyword.
1110       LIST ALL "KILL"
1110
1110 The bbs has been written to allow you to run one option/type up against
1110 the 'L' without including a space. This is for compatibility with earlier
1110 bbs's. Putting multiple options together without a space will result
1110 in a syntax error or the options being mistaken for a pattern. Here are
1110 some examples, notice that the order of the parameters is not important.
1110
1100    LIST ALL KILLED READ         [LA K R] or [LK A R]
1100    LIST BULLETIN READ "SALE"    [LB R SALE] or [LR SALE B]
1100
1110 For compatibility with older bbs's the LIST NTS command can be abbreviated
1110 as LT.
1110
1110 This bbs also lets you control if messages are displayed in ascending
1110 or descending order. Do you want to see the newest messages first,
1110 descending, or the oldest messages first, ascending.
1110
1110    LIST DESCENDING
1110    LIST ASCENDING
1110
1110 UNDERSTANDING A LISTING
1110
1110 One the BBS has found the messages you have requested, it will display
1110 them in a listing. The format of this listing is further described in
1110 "HELP LISTING".

1110
1110 This bbs connects at various times with a weather station operated in
1110 Bernal Heights, San Francisco. The WX command will display a page of
1110 of weather statistics and the time that it was downloaded. You can 
1110 request a crude graph of historical data on any of the weather
1110 parameters listed by supplying the individual parameter.
1110 You can also use this command to set the weather. It make take a
1110 while before your changes can be felt in your area. Also keep in mind
1110 that there are people living up there. The INDOOR keyword refers to the
1110 shack on the hill that houses the weather station, not your home.

1110 CHECK command ============================================================
1110    CHeck In|Out (msg_num_list)
1110
1110 When you plan to deliver an NTS message you check it out. This keeps the
1110 message on the system and allows the NTS manager to see who is processing
1110 the message. Once the message is delivered you KILL the message. If the
1110 message was undeliverable you may either CHECK it back in or EDIT the
1110 message header.
1100    CHECK OUT 3456 3466 3470   [CH O 3456 3466 3470]
1100    CHECK IN 3466              [CH I 3466]

!947

1110    CLubs [ADD|DELete|+|-] club_category_list
1110
1110 This bbs allows you to select a group of clubs or categories that you wish
1110 to see as if they were addressed to you. They will be listed with the LIST
1110 CLUBS command. Once you have listed each of the messages, it will be marked
1110 to indicate you have seen it and will not be displayed as part of the list
1110 the next time you log in. You have room to store 20 clubs. You add clubs to
1110 your list by typing ADD or + and the list. To see your current list of

1110 This information is kept locked in the system and can only be displayed
1110 by a sysop over a secure channel. It is used to help put newcomers with
1110 problems in touch with experienced users with similar gear. If someone
1110 asks me for help I will contact you and see if you are willing to lend
1110 a hand. I will not volunteer you without your consent. If you change your
1110 equipment you can simply overwrite the field by reentering the info. Or
1110 you may delete your entry by using DELETE. (See Also PHONE, PASSWORD)

!949
1110 COPY command =============================================================
1110    COpy msg_number user@bbs
1110
1110 The copy command is used to send a message to another user. If you are the
1110 originator of the original message than it is merely duplicated. If you
1110 are not, the message will be readdressed to show that it came from you and
1110 the original message header will be added to the body of the message. You
1110 are only allowed to copy one message to a single user per copy request.
1110 If you know you are going to be sending a message to multiple users when
1110 you enter the message the /CC command is a preferable method. (see SEND)
1100    COPY 3456 n6zfj @ n0ary       [CO 3456 n6zfj@n0ary]

!950
1110 DIR command ==============================================================
1110    DIR [path]
1110    LS [path]    (for you UNIX users)
1110
1110 These two commands are used to list the files in the currently selected
1110 directory. You can look in another directory by supplying a path. Your
1110 path may use either forward slashs (/) unix style, or back slashs (\)
1110 like dos. (See Also CD, READ, WRITE)
1100    DIR radio.mods

1100    DIR

!951
1110 EDIT command =============================================================
1110    EDit msg_number
1110
1110 If an NTS message needs to be readdressed you may do this directly. You
1110 will be prompted for changes, the current state will be displayed in []
1110 and to accept unchanged just press return. You can change the address
1110 and the subject line.
1100    EDIT 2034

!952
1110 EVENT command ============================================================
1110    EVent [ADD|DELete #]
1110    EVent # [Days|Weeks|Months] [keyword] [NOPrompt]
1110    EVent mo/yr [keyword] [NOPrompt]
1110
1110 The bbs has an events calendar to keep track of those important event
1110 in every ham's life: flea markets, exam dates, conventions, etc. You
1110 can list the events occuring in the next # of days, weeks or months, as
1110 well as events scheduled for a particular month. Your CLUB variable will
1110 be used to see what events to display to you. This keeps you from seeing
1110 club meeting notices that you are not interested in. To add an event is
1110 easy and you will be led through prompts for all the fields. Please
1110 refer to the "NOARY/BBS Users Manual" for detailed info on this command.
1100    EVENT 20 DAYS               [EV 20 D]
1100    EVENT 5/91                  [EV 5/91]

!953
1110 CALLBK commands ==========================================================
1110    LOOkup call_list
1110    SEArch
1110
1110 The LOOKUP command is used to find callbook information about a person
1110 when the callsign or portion of the callsign is known. The SEARCH command
1110 is used to locate hams by last name, city, state, zip, etc.
1110
1110 LOOKUP
1110    Callsigns consist of 3 parts, PREFIX, CALL AREA and SUFFIX. The PREFIX
1110    and CALL AREA can be replaced with a wildcard character '?' which will
1110    match anything in that field. If you wildcard the prefix it has to be
1110    the entire prefix, ?6AAA not K?6AAA. Here are some examples: 
1110       LOOKUP N0ARY N6ZFJ KB1AAA
1110       LOOKUP ?0ARY KB?AAA ??ZFJ
1110 
1110 SEARCH
1110    If you are trying to locate a ham but have forgotten the call you can
1110    have the bbs search for possible matches to name, city, state and zip.
1110    This is done by entering the SEARCH command and answering the prompts
1110    that follow. If the last name in question is fairly unique you should
1110    only supply the last name and leave the other fields blank. People are
1110    not very diligent in informing the FCC when they move, so addresses
1110    in the callbook are often out of date. First names are also a problem,
1110    the FCC requires proper first names, which often differ from the handle
1110    used on the air. In the event that the person has a common last name,
1110    Smith, you will be required to supply additional information. As a
1110    basic rule start broad and narrow your scope.
1110
1110    If more than 200 people match your request the bbs will abort and
1110    inform you of the problem. You will then have to narrow the scope and
1110    try again. The interactive SEARCH command also requires that the
1110    last name be a required field. If you wish to search on other fields,
1110    such as all the hams in a given zip code, you will have to make that
1110    request of the CALLBK server.

!954
1110 FILESYS commands =========================================================
1110    CD path
1110    DIr [path]
1110    LS [path]
1110    Read [File] filename [NOPrompt]
1110    WRite [File] filename [msg_num]
1110
1110 Files and directories can also be accessed via the server.

!955
1110 White Pages commands =====================================================
1110    FName [first_name]
1110    QTh [city_state]
1110    ZIp [zip_code]
1110    HOmebbs [homebbs]
1110
1110 These commands are used to display and set your White Pages entries in
1110 the local database. Once every few days users changes are collected and
1110 sent to the WP regional servers. 
1110 When setting your homebbs please leave off the SSID of the bbs
1110 call (-1). The QTH variable should be in the form "Sunnyvale, CA". And
1110 the ZIP should be just 5 digits. For addition information type HELP WP.

!956
1110 FORWARD command (SYSOP) ==================================================
1110    FOrward bbscall [msg_num_list]
1110
1110 This command allows a sysop to change the forwarding path for a list
1110 of messages. This is typically used when a bbs that is normally used
1110 for forwarding goes down. The sysop can force messages to be forwarded
1110 to an alternate bbs. (See Also EDIT, MAINTENANCE)
1110    FORWARD WA6LYZ 3423 3425 3466

!957
1110 HEADER keyword ===========================================================
1110    Read [Header] [msg_num_list]
1110
1110 When you do a read command without the HEADER keyword a line will be
1110 present that will show you the path that the message took to reach you.
1110 This is a list of calls separated by '!'s. The call on the left is the
1110 most recent bbs. If there are too many calls to fit on a single line the
1110 bbs will display "..." at the end to indicate that the list is partial.
1110    N6QMY!N6IYA!WA6RDH
1110
1110 If you desire more information about the routing of the message you can
1110 use the HEADER keyword to display full routing information. This infor-
1110 mation can vary between bbs's but what follows is fairly standard.
1110
1110       DATE  TIME      BBS @ ADDRESS        QTH    MSGNUM   ZIP
1110    R:910208/1415 @:N6QMY.#NOCAL.CA.USA.NA Fremont #:4673 Z:94536
1110    R:910208/2153 @:N6IYA.#NOCAL.CA.USA.NA Felton #:12621 Z:95018
1110    R:910208/2152 @:WA6RDH.#NOCAL.CA.USA.NA Dixon #:63073 Z:95620

!958
1110 ACTIVATE, HOLD and RELEASE commands (SYSOP) ==============================
1110    ACTivate [msg_num_list]
1110    HOLd [msg_num_list]
1110    RELease [msg_num_list]
1110
1110 ACTIVATE is used to restore a message that was killed by mistake.
1110
1110 HOLD and RELEASE are complimentary commands. Holding a message will
1110 make it immune to all the automatic processing of the BBS. It will
1110 not be deleted or forwarded until the RELEASE command has been issued.
1110 This is used to hold messages that are addressed in error, or 
1110 message that you don't want to be deleted due to aging.
1110
1100    ACTIVATE 4587 4599           [ACT 4587 4599]
1100    HOLD 4563 4566               [HOL 4563 4566]
1100    RELEASE 4563                 [REL 4563]

!959
1110 HELP command =============================================================
1110    Help Help <-- Type this for general information on how to use this bbs
1110    Help [command|keyword]
1110    ? [command|keyword]
1110    Help [0|1|2|3]
1110
1110 The '?' is a short cut for the keyword HELP. If you need help on a command
1110 or a keyword you just type HELP and the command name. If you supply a
1110 string that is too ambiguous to map to a single command or keyword you 
1110 will be presented with a list of commands/keywords that start with the
1110 first letter of the word you typed.
1110
1110    HELP SEND      will display information on SEND command
1110    HELP NOPROMPT  information on the NOPROMPT keyword and where used
1110    HELP CO        matches COPY and COMPUTER, displays all C commands
1110
1110 Use HELP # to change your current help level.
1110
1110 Every command and keyword used in this bbs has a help message associated
1110 with it. If you find one that is not please send me a message and I will
1110 add it. It is very important to me that these helps be accurate and
1110 helpful. Why else would we have them?
1110
1110 If you are going to capture a bunch of HELPs to disk then you will want
1110 to disable your LINES variable while you are doing this. This is done by
1110 typing: 
1110    LINES 0
1110    HELP whatever
1110    LINES 20

!960
1110 INITIATE command (SYSOP) =================================================
1110    INItiate [Wp|FIlesys|Callbk|Event|FOrwarding]
1110
1110 This command starts the desired server. This normally occurs auto-
1110 matically but there may be the need to do it manually. If there are
1110 no server functions pending the server will simply exit. For more
1110 information on the servers use the INFO command.
1100    INITIATE CALLBK             [INI C]

!961
1110 INFORMATION command ======================================================
1110    INFO [topic]
1110
1110 This command is used to display information on various topics. To get a
1110 list of current topics available you simply type INFO with no parameters.
1110 To look at a particular topic you type INFO and the topic. You have supply
1110 the entire topic name, don't abbreviate.
1100    INFO              show list of topics
1100    INFO HOMEBBS      show information definition and choosing a homebbs
1100    INFO CALLBK    	  show info on using on-line callbook
1110
1110 If you have suggestions for other topics for the INFO command please send
1110 a message to SYSOP.

!962
1110 KILL commands ============================================================
1110    Kill [Mine] [msg_num_list]
1110    Kill [FIle] [file_name_list]
1110    Kill [PROCess] process_number  <- SYSOP ONLY
1110    Kill msg_num_range [NOPrompt]  <- SYSOP ONLY
1110    Kill User callsign_list        <- SYSOP ONLY
1110
1110 The KILL command is used to mark a message or file for deletion. It will
1110 not be physically deleted for about 3 days. This gives you an opportunity
1110 to get a sysop to restore it, if you killed something by mistake. In
1110 general the keyword FILE is not necessary, if the supplied list is numbers
1110 the bbs assumes you are killing messages, a list of words indicates files.
1110 But if you want to be formal, go ahead. The keyword MINE will allow you
1110 to kill all of your mail at once. If you attempt to KILL something that
1110 hasn't been read you will be prompted for a confirmation. KM is a short
1110 form for KILL MINE.
1100    KILL MINE                   [KM]
1100    KILL 3456 3556 2344         [K 3456 3556 2344]
1100    KILL FILE ft470.mod         [K ft470.mod]
1100    KILL USER N0ZZZ             [KU n0zzz]

!963
1110 LINES and NOPROMPT commands ==============================================
1110    LINes [cnt]
1110       NOPrompt keyword used in READ, LIST
1110
1110 Since some users are using dumb terminals or possibly do not have disk
1110 capture in their communications software the bbs can be instructed to
1110 pause every X lines during long listing to allow you to catch up. It 
1110 also allows you the opportunity to abort the listing if you decide it
1110 is not worth reading. Setting this variable to zero (0) will have turn
1110 off the pause feature.
1110 
1110 Some commands that produce long listings can be instructed to ignore
1110 this variable for the duration of the command. This is done by including
1110 NOPROMPT (NOP) on the line with the command. It has the same affect as
1110 typing LINES 0; YOUR_LONG_COMMAND; LINES 20.
1100    LINES 18                    [LIN 18]
1100    READ NOPROMPT 3465          [R 3465 NOP]

!964
1110 LNAME command ============================================================
1110    LNAme [last_name]
1110
1110 Use this command to show or set your last name. This field is actually
1110 not used for anything other than general information. The field will
1110 typically be filled in on your initial contact by looking you up in
1110 the callbook.

!965
1110 MACRO command ============================================================
1110    MAcro
1110    MAcro # [command_list]
1110
1110 A macro is similar to programmable function keys on your computer. They
1110 allow you to perform a list of commands by typing a single character.
1110 This bbs allows each user to specify up to 10 macros that can be invoked
1110 by simply typing the macro number and returning. The command list can be
1110 any number of commands up to a total of 80 characters per macro. Commands
1110 must be separated by a semi-colon (;). Macro 0 has a special meaning. It
1110 is executed automatically upon connection with the bbs, very similar to
1110 an autoexec.bat or hello file. ***NOTE*** make sure you DO NOT put the
1110 BYE command in your macro 0. You will no longer be able to login.
1110
1110 Issuing MACRO with no number will display all of your current macros.
1110 Supplying a macro number but no string will clear the macro, setting it
1110 to empty.
1110    MACRO 0 READ MINE; KILL MINE; LIST    [MA 0 RM;KM;L]
1110    MACRO 1 LIST LAST 100 "ICOM"          [MA 1 LL 100 ICOM]
1110    MACRO 9 KILL MINE; BYE                [MA 9 KM;B]
1110    MACRO 8                               [MA 8]

!966
1110 MESSAGE/MAIL commands ====================================================
1110    List [type] [options] [range] [pattern]
1110    Read [Mine|msg_num_list] [Header] [Kill]
1110    Send type call [@address] [<from] [$bid] [!password]
1110    Kill [Mine|msg_num_list]
1110
1110 The bbs remembers the last message number you referenced. If you don't
1110 supply a message number explicitly in the command the bbs will assume
1110 that you wish to perform the command on the earlier message. This can
1110 reduce your chances of typing a message number wrong or forgetting it.
1110    READ 8769
1110    KILL
1110    REPLY
1110
1110 All of the preceeding will use the message number 8769. Make sure that
1110 you don't reverse KILL and REPLY or the message that will be killed will
1110 be the reply you just sent.

!967
1110 ME and WHO commands ======================================================
1110    ME
1110    WHO [call]
1110
1110 These commands display information about the desired user. ME is the
1110 same as typing WHO with your own call. It displays the user information
1110 structure, WP and callbook information. Of course the protected fields
1110 will not be displayed.

!968
1110 MINE keyword =============================================================
1110    Read Mine
1110    Kill Mine
1110    List Mine
1110
1110 This keyword will cause the TO field in the message address to be compared
1110 to your call. If it matches the function is performed. It will scan the
1110 entire message database looking for matches. This is not the case with
1110 the list command if additional options are supplied.

!969
1110 MOTD keyword =============================================================
1110    Read MOtd
1110
1110 MOTD stands for "message of the day". This message is displayed upon
1110 connection and is used to inform you of new features, and timely
1110 information. In this bbs once you have seen the message it will no
1110 longer be displayed on each connect. You may recall the message by
1110 entering the READ MOTD command.
1110
1110 Whenever a sysop changes the contents of the MOTD he will issue a
1110 command that will reset each user so they will see the message on
1110 their next connect.

!970
1110 NTS commands =============================================================
1110    Send NTs [zip@NTSst]
1110    ST [zip@NTSst]
1110    Edit nts_msg_num
1110    CHeck [IN|OUt] nts_msg_num
1110    Read nts_msg_num
1110    List NTs
1110    LT
1110
1110 NTS message are health and welfare messages that are sent via ham radio
1110 to people who may or may not be hams. They could also be originated by
1110 non hams. 
1110
1110 When an NTS message arrives here for delivery every user is invited to
1110 participate in the delivery. Here is all you do: 
1110    LIST NTS             list messages waiting to be delivered [LT]
1110    READ msg_num         get a hard copy of the message
1110    CHECK OUT msg_num    tell the system that you will deliver the msg
1110
1110 If delivery was successful: 
1110    KILL msg_num
1110
1110 If delivery is not possible: 
1110    CHECK IN msg_num     make it available for someone else to try
1110 or
1110    EDIT msg_num         change address to another nts bbs

!971
1110 PHONE and PASSWORD commands ==============================================
1110    PHone [DELETE|-|your_number]
1110    PASSWORD your_new_password
1110
1110 I discuss these together to hopefully reduce your worries about invasion
1110 of privacy. I would like to have all my users phone numbers on file so
1110 that I can give you a call if someone is looking for help and shares
1110 your equipment setup, or if I need some information from you. This entry
1110 as well as your equipment database entries can not be read out over
1110 packet. It is only accessible on my computer console or over the modem.
1110 And then only by a sysop. You can also apply a PASSWORD to your account
1110 that will keep others from coming in on a secure line and looking at
1110 your data. You may want to set these entries up over the phone modem
1110 if you are worried about people listening in.
1110 (See Also TNC, SOFTWARE, COMPUTER, RIG)
1100    PHONE 408-555-1212          [PH 4085551212]  please include areacode
1100    PHONE DELETE                [PH -]
1100    PASSWORD burp

!972
1110 PORT command =============================================================
1110    Ports [TNC]
1110
1110 This command will list the current users logged into the system and
1110 by which method they are entering, 144, 220, 440, phone, console. It
1110 actually executes the following unix command: 
1110    ps -ax | grep bbs | grep -v grep
1110 Adding the TNC keyword will also display the tnc driver processes.

!973
1110 REPLY command ============================================================
1110    REPly [msg_num]
1110    SR [msg_num]      (included now for compatibility)
1110
1110 This command will take the message supplied or optionally the last message
1110 read or killed and generate a reply. It will do the addressing and change
1110 the subject by putting "Re: " in front of the original subject. All you
1110 need to do is type the body of the message. (See Also SEND)
1110
1110 A conflict may arise if the person orginating the message had sent it from
1110 a bbs other than his home bbs. You will be prompted for additional instr-
1110 uctions if you are at help levels 2 or 3.
1100    REPLY 3245                 [REP 3245] or [SR 3245]

!974
1110 READ command =============================================================
1110    Read [Mine] [Header] [msg_num_list] [NOPrompt] [Kill]
1110    RM [Header] [NOPrompt]
1110    RK [Header] [NOPrompt]
1110    RH [Mine] [msg_num_list] [NOPrompt]
1110    Read [FIle] [file_name] [NOPrompt]
1110    Read Who [msg_num_list]
1110    RW [msg_num_list]
1110
1110 This command is used to read both messages and files. It distinguishes
1110 messages from files by the request list, numbers indicate messages and
1110 words indicate files. You can optionally include the keyword FILE to
1110 make it clearer but this is not required.
1110 
1110 On messages you can use the MINE keyword to read just the mail addressed
1110 to you, see HELP MINE. The HEADER keyword will result in the entire
1110 routing header being displayed with the message, see HELP HEADER. The
1110 WHO keyword is used to list the callsigns of all the users that have
1110 read the message.
1110
1110 The NOPROMPT keyword will override your LINES variable for this command.
1110 Allowing you to capture to disk with out having the pauses occuring 
1110 every X number of lines, see HELP NOPROMPT.
1100    READ MINE HEADER               [RM H]
1100    READ FILE NTS.INFO NOPROMPT    [R NTS.INFO NOP]
1100    READ WHO 3456 3546             [RW 3456 3546]

!975
1110 SSID information =========================================================
1110 The SSID is the -X that is added to a call to access a PBBS and at times
1110 to contact another user keyboard to keyboard. Once you are in the BBS 
1110 system this number is no longer used. To the rest of the world we are
1110 known as %B not %B-1. In your mail and when answering bbs questions
1110 please use our hierarchical address: 
1110
1110    YOURCALL @ %B.#NOCAL.CA.USA.NA
1110
1110 When you are talking to people about connecting with the bbs via packet
1110 on RF use: 
1110
1110    %B-1 on 144.93 Mhz

!976
1110 SEND command =============================================================
1110    Send [type] call[@homebbs] [<from] [$bid] [!password]
1110    SB topic[@distribution] [<from] [$bid]
1110    SD list [<from] [$bid]
1110    SP call[@homebbs] [<from] [$bid]
1110    ST zipcode[@NTSst] [<from] [$bid]
1110    SS call [<from] [$bid] [!password]
1110    SR call[@homebbs]
1110
1110 This command is used to initiate a message to another user. There are
1110 4 type of messages that can be originated on this system,
1110 
1110 Personal [SP]
1110    can be read only by you and the addressee.
1110 Bulletin [SB]
1110    can be read by anyone
1110 Nts [SN | ST]
1110    this is health and welfare traffic
1110 Secure [SS]
1110    this is a Personal message that can only be read when connected to
1110    the bbs over the phone line or on the system console. This message
1110    can also have a password assigned to it. These messages will not
1110    be forwarded and are therefore only for local users.
1110 Reply [SR]
1110    see the REPLY command for discription.
1110 
1110 If the addressee is in the local WP database you don't have to provide
1110 the @homebbs, the system already knows it. For further information on
1110 the send command please refer to the manual. (See Also REPLY, COPY)
1100    SEND PERSONAL KC6ZZZ        [SP KC6ZZZ]
1100    SEND SECURE KC6ZZZ !DOGGY   [SS KC6ZZZ !DOGGY]
1100    SEND NTS 94086 @ NTSCA      [ST 94086@NTSCA]
1110
1110 If a distribution list has been created you can send a message to
1110 multiple users at once by refering to the distribution list name.
1110 Type INFO DISTRIB for more information.
1110
1110 There are a number of options that can be used while entering a message
1110 body. All of these commands are distinquished from message text becuase
1110 they immediately follow a carriage return.
1110
1110 /EX
1110    This is used to terminate input to a message, indicates to the bbs that
1110    you are done. You may also use ^Z or a period. The period is for
1110    UNIX compatibility.
1110
1110 /AB
1110    Use this when you wish to abort a message without sending it.
1110
1110 /INclude [msg_num|file_name]
1110    This command will include the supplied message into the body of your
1110    message. Each line of the included text will begin with a '>' so that
1110    the reader can identify the included section.
1110
1110 /CC
1110    Using this command will instruct the bbs that you are done typing the
1110    message body and would like the message to be sent to other users as
1110    well. This is very similar to using the COPY command with the exception
1110    that with this command a CC: CALL line will be added to the bottom
1110    of the message for each call you supply. You will be prompted for 
1110    additional calls, simply return to indicate you are done.
1110
1110 /SIgnature
1110    Place the users signature in the message at the current position.
1110    The signature is created with the SIGNATURE command. It is commonly
1110    used to store your standard closing and return address. Type HELP
1110    SIGNATURE at the bbs prompt for more info.
1110
1110 /NUmber
1110    Print the current message being entered with line numbers to facilitate
1110    editing.
1110
1110 /EDit line_num
1110    This command will print the line number in question and allow you to
1110    retype it. If you have chosen this line by mistake just type a 
1110    carriage return and the line will be unchanged.
1110
1110 /ADd line_num
1110    Insert the next line typed just before the line specified.
1110
1110 /KIll line_num
1110    Delete the line specified from the message body.
1110
1110 /?
1110 /HElp
1110    Will display a menu of send commands while in input mode.

!977
1110 SHELL command ==========================================================
1110    SHELL user                   (Attempt UNIX log in on BBS machine)
1110
1110 Attempt to log in to the BBS machine as the named user. You will be
1110 prompted for the user's password, and, if sucessful, will be given
1110 UNIX shell access. To return to the BBS simply type "exit".
1110
1110 It is not wise to use this command over an unsecure channel unless the
1110 user in question has been set up to use a one-time password setup,
1110 such as S/KEY or OPIE.

!978
1110 SKIP command =============================================================
1110    SKip [ADD|DELete|+|-] [club_category_list]
1110
1110 This does just the opposite of the CLUBS command. Items placed in this
1110 list will not be displayed when you request a list of messages. It is a
1110 way of striping away the junk mail you never read. Of course you can
1110 never get rid of all of it. You add categories to your skip list by
1110 typing ADD or + and the list. To see your current list of skips type
1110 SKIP alone. (See Also CLUBS)
1100    SKIP ADD SPECS SALE       [SK + SPECS SALE]
1100    SKIP DELETE AMSAT         [SK - AMSAT]
1110
1110 You can override this by using the ALL keyword during your LIST request.

!979
1110 SPAWN command ============================================================
1110    SPAWN [TNC144|TNC220|TNC440] (SYSOP)
1110
1110 When a tnc process has died, either because it was killed by the unix
1110 OS or a sysop with the KILL PROCESS command, this command will allow
1110 the tnc process to be restarted. Verify that the tnc process is actually
1110 gone by issuing a PORTS TNC command first. (See Also KILL PROCESS, PORTS)

!980
1110 USERS command ============================================================
1110    USers call_list
1110    USers [cnt] 
1110 These commands display the last connect status which includes time,
1110 date, login count and method of connect. The first form does it for
1110 the supplied calls. The second form will list the last X number of
1110 people to connect, if no number is given it defaults to 10.
1100    USERS N0ARY N6ZFJ             [US N0ARY N6ZFJ]
1100    USERS 20                      [US 20]

!981
1110 EMAIL command ============================================================
1110    EMail [address]
1110    EMail ON|OFF
1110 If you have an email address that is in some way accessible from the
1110 internet, you can have your mail forwarded from the packet system
1110 to your email address. First you must tell the bbs your email address.
1110    EMAIL bob@arasmith.com
1110    EMAIL suny!connie@arasmith.com
1110    EMAIL 1432587@mcimail.com
1110
1110 This in itself does nothing. You now have to instruct the system to
1110 start forwarding your mail. You can enable and disable this forwarding
1110 without changing your address.
1110    EMAIL ON
1110    EMAIL OFF

!982
1110 White Pages commands =====================================================
1110    WHEreis call
1110    WP call
1110
1110 The White Pages is a directory of almost all the hams that are currently
1110 using the packet bbs system. As soon as you choose a homebbs the bbs
1110 system is notified, the regional servers distribute updates to all bbs's.
1110 This allows you to send a message to someone without having to know their
1110 homebbs. These commands are used to see if a user is in our white pages
1110 database. Your WP information is updated via the USER commands.
1110 (See Also FNAME, QTH, ZIP, HOME)
1100    WHEREIS n0ary                [WHE n0ary | WP n0ary]

!983
1110 WRITE command ============================================================
1110    WRite filename           (upload a file)
1110    WRite filename [msg_num] (copy a message to a file)
1110
1110 This command is used to upload a file to the system or to create a 
1110 permanent record of a bulletin or other message by also supplying
1110 the message number to save.
1110
1110 In upload usage, upon issuing the command you are placed in input mode
1110 until one of the standard methods of terminating a message input is
1110 encountered, ^Z, /ex, etc.
1110
1110 In the message copy usage (by adding an additional message number to the
1110 command), the system will search for the given message number, and if it
1110 is found, its body will be copied to the given filename.
1110
1110 The file will be written into the current directory. The file will
1110 not actually become visible until a sysop has reviewed it. Files 
1110 are not subject to aging and are therefore expensive from a disk
1110 space point of view. (See Also READ FILE, DIR, LS, CD)
1100    WRITE FT470.MODS             [WR FT470.MODS]
1100    WRITE NCPA.bbs.list 1450     [WR NCPA.BBS.LIST 1450]

!984
1110 SYSOP commands ===========================================================
1110    HOLd [msg_num_list]
1110    RELease [msg_num_list]
1110    Kill Process process_number
1110    Kill User call_list

1110    SET [callsign] [user_parameter [value]]
1110    SHell

!985
1110 KEYWORD list =============================================================
1110 These are reserved words that are interpreted by the system as commands or
1110 options to commands. You should not use them in file names, etc.
1110
1110    ADDRESS ADD ALL APPROVED ASCENDING BAROMETER BBS

1110
1110 The parser is context sensitive. The same letter may be used to identify
1110 different keywords but only one will be valid in the context of the
1110 command. For instance: 
1110    LH   (LIST HELD messages)
1110    RH   (READ with HEADER)
1110
1110 This also means that in many cases you may use these keywords in some
1110 commands where the keyword would not have a meaning normally: 
1110    LIST HELP
1110
1110 Since HELP is not a keyword for the LIST command it will be parsed and
1110 assumed to be a pattern to search for in the To, From, or Subject fields.
1110 See the LIST command for information on pattern matching.

!986 INFO
1110 CHOOSING A HOME BBS ======================================================
1110 When choosing a home bbs you should find a bbs that is near your packet
1110 station and has a reliable path. DXing to bbs is discouraged, all bbs's
1110 carry the same bulletins. Also sending messages from a bbs that is not
1110 your home bbs can corrupt your white pages entry. For those that have
1110 tnc's with a personal mailbox don't put your tnc's call in this field.
1110 Your home bbs has to be able to support bulletin and message forwarding.
1110 If your are in the San Francisco area, or this bbs is easy for you to
1110 connect to, you're welcome to join us here, enter "HOME %B".

!987
1110 Listing format ===========================================================
1110
1110 Once the BBS has found the messages you have requested in a "LIST"
1110 command, it will display them in a listing with the following fields:
1110 
1110  Msg#  Stat  Size      To       From  Cnt Date/Time Subject
1110  5764  abcd  2004 WA6GFY@N0ARY  N6ZFJ   1 0210/2141 Re: Field Day

1110 SIGNATURE ================================================================
1110    SIGNature
1110    SIGNature [Write|Kill]
1110    SIGNature [ON|OFF]
1110
1110 A signature is a block of text that you can store in the system and
1110 copy into your messages with a single command /SIgnature. This sign-
1110 ature can be as simple as your call and return address. Here is an
1110 example:
1110
1110    73, bob
1110        N0ARY @ N0ARY.#NOCAL.CA.USA.NA
1110        bob@arasmith.com
1110
1110 When you are finished creating a message you type a /SI just before the
1110 /EX and your signature will be copied into the message body.
1110
1110 To see you current signature you can type SIGNATURE at the bbs main
1110 prompt. To create a signature you type SIGNATURE WRITE and to delete
1110 your signature from your account type SIGNATURE KILL.
1110
1110 If you set SIGNATURE ON you don't have to type the /SI to have it
1110 inserted in the message, it will happen automatically everytime when
1110 you type /EX or /CC.

1110 Gateway commands ========================================================
1110    CONnect call port [Via digi_calls]  (Connect to remote AX.25 station)
1110    TELnet host [port_num]              (Connect to remote Internet host)
1110    AXrelay ssid_num                    (Change your outgoing SSID)
1110
1110 Gateway commands allow you to connect to another station or computer from
1110 the BBS. The "CONnect" command makes connections over the air using the
1110 AX.25 packet network, while the "TELnet" command makes a connection
1110 through the Internet. To avoid network station name collisions, the BBS
1110 will attempt to pick an unused substation id (SSID) to attach to your
1110 callsign for the outbound connection. A full description of this process
1110 and a way to change it are documented in the AXRelay command.
1110
1110 Once connected you will be placed in remote session mode (Keyword:
1110 Session).

!1001
1110 Session mode ============================================================
1110 When you establish a connection with a remote station or Internet host
1110 using the BBS, everything you type from then on will be sent to the
1110 remote station. This behavior is called the Session mode.
1110 
1110 The BBS will remain in Session mode until the connection is dropped
1110 by the remote side or until you abort it using the Session Attention
1110 Sequence. The Session Attention Sequence is a tilde character ("~") sent
1110 on a line of its own.
1110
1110 If for some reason you really need to send the session attention sequence
1110 to the remote side then you can escape the attention sequence by sending
1110 two tildes in a row (~~). The BBS will remove the first tilde and send
1110 the remaing one (or more, if given) onward to the remote side.
1100   ~  (Abort connection, when sent on a line of its own)

!1002
1110 CONNECT command =========================================================
1110   CONnect call [Via digi_calls] [ON] port
1110
1110 Connect to another packet station via one of the BBS's AX.25 packet TNC
1110 ports. (See PORTS for a list of available ports that can be used). Each
1110 port is connected to a different frequency, so you should choose the
1110 port based on the station you wish to reach.
1110
1110 If you wish the connection to be made via a digipeater (or several
1110 digipeaters) you must use the "Via" keyword and supply the list of
1110 digipeater callsigns, separated by commas. Do not use spaces between
1110 digipeaters.
1110
1110 The BBS must make the connection using your callsign, but it must also
1110 avoid a colliding with the very callsign you may be using to access the
1110 BBS if you are connected via a TNC. To solve this problem the BBS will
1110 try to append a substation identifier (SSID) to your callsign. For more
1110 information on the process and to change this behavior, see the AXrelay
1110 command.
1110
1110 Established connections place you in Session Mode, which is described in
1110 further detail under the "Session" keyword.
1110
1110 (See also: AXRelay, Keyword: Gateway, Session)
1100  CONNECT %B ON TNC0
1100  CONNECT %B-1 VIA %C-4,OSI TNC1

!1003
1110 TELNET command =========================================================
1110   TELnet host [port_num]
1110
1110 Connect to a host on the Internet using TCP/IP. Host can be a domain
1110 name or an IP address (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx). If you do not specify a port
1110 number then the connection will be made to the default telnet port number,
1110 23.
1110
1110 While the connection is being set up and after it is made, you will
1110 be in connection SESSION mode (See also: Session).

!1004
1110 AXRelay command =========================================================
1110    AXRelay ssid_num                    (Change your outgoing SSID)
1110    AXRelay AUTO                        (Revert to automatic method)
1110
1110 When the BBS makes a connection to another AX.25 packet station on your
1110 behalf, it must use your callsign as the source address in each packet
1110 of the transmission, but it also must avoid a collision with the very
1110 callsign you may be using to access the BBS if you are connected to it
1110 using a TNC. To solve this problem the BBS will find an address to use
1110 via one of two methods: it will use the address previously configured in
1110 your user profile with the AXRelay command, or it will try to create a
1110 new, unique address automatically.
1110
1110 Under the automatic procedure, the BBS will choose an outgoing address
1110 by append a substation identifier (SSID) to your callsign in the outgoing
1110 connection. First, the BBS will examine the SSID on your incoming
1110 connection and add a one to it. If your incoming connection was made
1110 without an SSID then the outgoing connection will be made with SSID 1.
1110 If the incoming SSID is 15 then the outgoing SSID will be 0 (none).
1110
1110 If you wish to override this behavior and use a specific outgoing SSID,
1110 issue the AXRelay command, specify an SSID between 0 and 15 (inclusive),
1110 and that SSID will be saved in your user profile and used thereafter
1110 (until changed).
