/* Software timers
 *
 * There is one of these structures for each simulated timer.
 *
 * Whenever the timer is running, it is on a sorted, doubly-linked list
 * pointed to by "timers" so that the timer checking routine
 * can quickly run through the list and check for those timers that have
 * expired.
 *
 * Additionally, the application event processing loop can quickly ask
 * for the first timer that is due to expire and plan accordingly.
 *
 * Stopping a timer or letting it expire causes it to be removed
 * from the list; starting a timer puts it on the list.
